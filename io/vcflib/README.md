## overview

The [Variant Call Format (VCF)](http://www.1000genomes.org/wiki/Analysis/Variant%20Call%20Format/vcf-variant-call-format-version-41)
is a flat-file, tab-delimited textual format
intended to concisely describe reference-indexed variations between individuals. 
VCF provides a common interchange format for the description of variation in individuals and populations of samples,
and has become the _defacto_ standard reporting format for a wide array of genomic variant detectors.

vcflib provides methods to manipulate and interpret sequence variation as it can be described by VCF.
It is both:

 * an API for parsing and operating on records of genomic variation as it can be described by the VCF format,
 * and a collection of command-line utilities for executing complex manipulations on VCF files.

The API itself provides a quick and extremely permissive method to read and write VCF files.
Extensions and applications of the library provided in the included utilities (*.cpp) comprise the vast bulk of the library's utility for most users.

## usage

vcflib provides a variety of functions for VCF manipulation:

### comparison

 * Generate **haplotype-aware intersections** ([vcfintersect](#vcfintersect) -i), **unions** (vcfintersect -u), and **complements** (vcfintersect -v -i).
 * **Overlay-merge** multiple VCF files together, using provided order as precedence ([vcfoverlay](#vcfoverlay)).
 * **Combine** multiple VCF files together, handling samples when alternate allele descriptions are identical ([vcfcombine](#vcfcombine)).
 * **Validate** the integrity and identity of the VCF by verifying that the VCF record's REF matches a given reference file ([vcfcheck](#vcfcheck)).

### format conversion

 * Convert a VCF file into a per-allele or per-genotype **tab-separated (.tsv)** file ([vcf2tsv](#vcf2tsv)).
 * Store a VCF file in an **SQLite3** database (vcf2sqlite.py).
 * Make a **BED file** from the intervals in a VCF file (vcf2bed.py).

### filtering and subsetting

 * **Filter** variants and genotypes using arbitrary expressions based on values in the INFO and sample fields ([vcffilter](#vcffilter)).
 * **Randomly sample** a subset of records from a VCF file, given a rate ([vcfrandomsample](#vcfrandomsample)).
 * **Select variants** of a certain type (vcfsnps, vcfbiallelic, vcfindels, vcfcomplex, etc.)

### annotation

 * **Annotate** one VCF file with fields from the INFO column of another, based on position ([vcfaddinfo](#vcfaddinfo), [vcfintersect](#vcfintersect)).
 * Incorporate annotations or targets provided by a *BED* file ([vcfannotate](#vcfannotate), [vcfintersect](#vcfintersect)).
 * Examine **genotype correspondence** between two VCF files by annotating samples in one file with genotypes from another ([vcfannotategenotypes](#vcfannotategenotypes)).
 * Annotate variants with the **distance** to the nearest variant ([vcfdistance](#vcfdistance)).
 * Count the number of alternate alleles represented in samples at each variant record ([vcfaltcount](#vcfaltcount)).
 * **Subset INFO fields** to decrease file size and processing time ([vcfkeepinfo](#vcfkeepinfo)).
 * Lighten up VCF files by keeping only a **subset of per-sample information** ([vcfkeepgeno](#vcfkeepgeno)).
 * **Numerically index** alleles in a VCF file ([vcfindex](#vcfindex)).

### samples

 * Quickly obtain the **list of samples** in a given VCF file ([vcfsamplenames](#vcfsamplenames)).
 * **Remove samples** from a VCF file ([vcfkeepsamples](#vcfkeepsamples), [vcfremovesamples](#vcfremovesamples)).

### ordering

 * **Sort variants** by genome coordinate ([vcfstreamsort](#vcfstreamsort)).
 * **Remove duplicate** variants in vcfstreamsort'ed files according to their REF and ALT fields ([vcfuniq](#vcfuniq)).

### variant representation

 * **Break multiallelic** records into multiple records ([vcfbreakmulti](#vcfbreakmulti)), retaining allele-specific INFO fields.
 * **Combine overlapping biallelic** records into a single record ([vcfcreatemulti](#vcfcreatemulti)).
 * **Decompose complex variants** into a canonical SNP and indel representation ([vcfallelicprimitives](#vcfallelicprimitives)), generating phased genotypes for available samples.
 * **Reconstitute complex variants** provided a phased VCF with samples ([vcfgeno2haplo](#vcfgeno2haplo)).
 * **Left-align indel and complex variants** ([vcfleftalign](#vcfleftalign)).

### genotype manipulation

 * **Set genotypes** in a VCF file provided genotype likelihoods in the GL field ([vcfglxgt](#vcfglxgt)).
 * Establish putative **somatic variants** using reported differences between germline and somatic samples ([vcfsamplediff](#vcfsamplediff)).
 * Remove samples for which the reported genotype (GT) and observation counts disagree (AO, RO) ([vcfremoveaberrantgenotypes](#vcfremoveaberrantgenotypes)).

### interpretation and classification of variants

 * Obtain aggregate **statistics** about VCF files ([vcfstats](#vcfstats)).
 * Print the **receiver-operating characteristic (ROC)** of one VCF given a truth set ([vcfroc](#vcfroc)).
 * Annotate VCF records with the **Shannon entropy** of flanking sequence ([vcfentropy](#vcfentropy)).
 * Calculate the heterozygosity rate ([vcfhetcount](#vcfhetcount)).
 * Generate potential **primers** from VCF records ([vcfprimers](#vcfprimers)), to check for genome uniqueness.
 * Convert the numerical represenation of genotypes provided by the GT field to a **human-readable genotype format** ([vcfgenotypes](#vcfgenotypes)).
 * Observe how different alignment parameters, including context and entropy-dependent ones, influence **variant classification and interpretation** ([vcfremap](#vcfremap)).
 * **Classify variants** by annotations in the INFO field using a self-organizing map ([vcfsom](#vcfsom)); **re-estimate their quality** given known variants.


A number of "helper" perl and python scripts (e.g. vcf2bed.py, vcfbiallelic) further extend functionality.

In practice, users are encouraged to drive the utilities in the library in a streaming fashion, using pipes, to fully utilize resources on multi-core systems during interactive work.  Piping provides a convenient method to interface with other libraries (vcf-tools, BedTools, GATK, htslib, bcftools, freebayes) which interface via VCF files, allowing the composition of an immense variety of processing functions.

## development

See src/vcfecho.cpp for basic usage.  src/Variant.h and src/Variant.cpp describe methods available in the API.
vcflib is incorporated into several projects, such as [freebayes](https://github.com/ekg/freebayes), which may provide a point of reference for prospective developers.
Additionally, developers should be aware of that vcflib contains submodules (git repositories) comprising its dependencies (outside of lzib and a *nix environment).


## installing

vcflib includes submodules, so to obtain vcflib you have to use:

    % git clone --recursive git://github.com/ekg/vcflib.git

or

    % git clone --recursive https://github.com/ekg/vcflib.git

To build, use Make:

    % cd vcflib
    % make

Executables are built into the ./bin directory in the repository.
A number of shell, perl, python, and R scripts already reside there.
This makes installation easy, as users can add vcflib/bin to their path, or copy the contained executables to a directory already in their path.


## executables

### vcf2tsv
    
    usage: vcf2tsv [-n null_string] [-g] [vcf file]
    Converts stdin or given VCF file to tab-delimited format, using null string to replace empty values in the table.
    Specifying -g will output one line per sample with genotype information.
    
### vcfaddinfo
    
    usage: vcfaddinfo <vcf file> <vcf file>
    Adds info fields from the second file which are not present in the first vcf file.
    
    
### vcfafpath

                                with this flag
    
    If multiple alleleic primitives (gaps or mismatches) are specified in
    a single VCF record, split the record into multiple lines, but drop all
    INFO fields.  "Pure" MNPs are split into multiple SNPs unless the -m
    flag is provided.  Genotypes are phased where complex alleles have been
    decomposed, provided genotypes in the input.

    
### vcfaltcount
    
Counts the number of alternate alleles in the record.
    
    
### vcfannotate

Combines VCF files positionally, combining samples when sites and alleles are identical.
Any number of VCF files may be combined.  The INFO field and other columns are taken from
one of the files which are combined when records in multiple files match.  Alleles must
have identical ordering to be combined into one record.  If they do not, multiple records
will be emitted.


### vcfcommonsamples
    
    usage: vcfcommonsamples <vcf file> <vcf file> outputs each record in the
    first file, removing samples not present in the second
    
    
### vcfcountalleles

                              regions may be specified.

    Filter the specified vcf file using the set of filters.
    Filters are specified in the form "<ID> <operator> <value>:
     -f "DP > 10"  # for info fields
     -g "GT = 1|1" # for genotype fields
     -f "CpG"  # for 'flag' fields

    Operators can be any of: =, !, <, >, |, &

    Any number of filters may be specified.  They are combined via logical AND
    unless --or is specified on the command line.  Obtain logical negation through
    the use of parentheses, e.g. "! ( DP = 10 )"

    For convenience, you can specify "QUAL" to refer to the quality of the site, even
    though it does not appear in the INFO fields.

    
### vcffixup

Count the allele frequencies across alleles present in each record in the 
VCF file.  (Similar to vcftools --freq.)

Uses genotypes from the VCF file to correct AC (alternate allele count), AF
(alternate allele frequency), NS (number of called), in the VCF records.  For
example:

    % vcfkeepsamples file.vcf NA12878 | vcffixup - | vcffilter -f "AC > 0"

used when preparing VCF files for input to freebayes to decrease positional
representation differences between the input alleles and left-realigned
alignments.

        -r, --reference FILE  Use this reference as a basis for realignment.
        -w, --window N        Use a window of this many bp when left aligning (150).

    Left-aligns variants in the specified input file or stdin.  Window size is determined
    dynamically according to the entropy of the regions flanking the indel.  These must have
    entropy > 1 bit/bp, or be shorter than ~5kb.

    For each VCF record, extract the flanking sequences, and write them to stdout as FASTA
    records suitable for alignment.  This tool is intended for use in designing validation
    experiments.  Primers extracted which would flank all of the alleles at multi-allelic
    sites.  The name of the FASTA "reads" indicates the VCF record which they apply to.
    The form is >CHROM_POS_LEFT for the 3' primer and >CHROM_POS_RIGHT for the 5' primer,
    for example:
    
    >20_233255_LEFT

        -f, --fields "FIELD ..."  INFO fields to provide to the SOM
        -a, --apply FILE       apply the saved map to input data to FILE
        -s, --save  FILE       train on input data and save the map to FILE
        -t, --print-training-results
                               print results of SOM on training input
                               (you can also just use --apply on the same input)
        -x, --width X          width in columns of the output array
        -y, --height Y         height in columns of the output array
        -i, --iterations N     number of training iterations or epochs
        -d, --debug            print timing information
    
    recalibration:
    
        -c, --center X,Y       annotate with euclidean distance from center
        -p, --paint-true VCF   use VCF file to annotate true variants (multiple)
        -f, --paint-false VCF  use VCF file to annotate false variants (multiple)
        -R, --paint-tag TAG    provide estimated FDR% in TAG in variant INFO
        -N, --false-negative   replace FDR% (false detection) with FNR% (false negative)
    
    
### vcfstats
    
    usage: vcfstats [options] <vcf file>
    
        -r, --region          specify a region on which to target the stats, requires a BGZF
                              compressed file which has been indexed with tabix.  any number of
                              regions may be specified.
        -a, --add-info        add the statistics intermediate information to the VCF file,
                              writing out VCF records instead of summary statistics
        -l, --no-length-frequency    don't out the indel and mnp length-frequency spectra
        -m, --match-score N          match score for SW algorithm
        -x, --mismatch-score N       mismatch score for SW algorithm
        -o, --gap-open-penalty N     gap open penalty for SW algorithm
        -e, --gap-extend-penalty N   gap extension penalty for SW algorithm
    
    Prints statistics about variants in the input VCF file.
    
    
### vcfstreamsort
    
Reads VCF on stdin and guarantees that the positional order is correct provided out-of-order
variants are no more than 100 positions in the VCF file apart.


### vcfuniq

Like GNU uniq, but for VCF records.  Remove records which have the same positon, ref, and alt
as the previous record.


### vcfuniqalleles

For each record, remove any duplicate alternate alleles that may have resulted from merging
separate VCF files.
